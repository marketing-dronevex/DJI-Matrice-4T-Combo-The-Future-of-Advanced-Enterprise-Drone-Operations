## Introduction  
The DJI Matrice 4T Combo is a cutting-edge enterprise drone engineered for precision, versatility, and efficiency in demanding professional applications. Combining thermal imaging and high-resolution multi-sensor cameras, robust AI-powered autonomous features, and advanced flight safety, this drone sets new benchmarks for aerial inspections, search and rescue, surveillance, and mapping.

## Multi-Sensor Camera System  
Equipped with three high-performance cameras — a 48MP wide-angle, a 48MP medium telephoto, and a thermal sensor — the Matrice 4T captures detailed images and thermal data simultaneously. The telephoto lens supports up to 7x optical zoom, enabling clear views of distant objects for precision inspections and observations.

## Intelligent AI Features  
The drone’s onboard AI enables real-time detection of people, vehicles, and marine vessels, facilitating autonomous operations through Smart Track, FlyTo, POI, and Cruise modes. These intelligent flight features make complex mission execution more efficient, reducing pilot workload and enhancing data accuracy.

## Extended Flight Performance  
With a maximum flight time of up to 49 minutes and a top speed of 21 m/s, the Matrice 4T supports long, uninterrupted missions. Its rugged design allows operation in harsh environments from -20°C to 50°C, extending usability to diverse outdoor conditions.

## Advanced Safety and Control  
Omnidirectional obstacle sensing guards against in-flight collisions, while redundant systems assure mission reliability. The drone offers multiple control options including the DJI RC Plus 2 Enterprise controller, with secure long-range transmission of up to 15 km aided by O4 Enterprise technology.

## High-Precision Mapping & Inspection  
Designed for detailed mapping, the Matrice 4T supports 5-directional oblique imaging, intelligent 3D capture, and integration with DJI Pilot 2 for automated report generation. These qualities make it invaluable for infrastructure inspections, energy sector monitoring, and public safety applications.

## Accessories and Package Contents  
The Combo kit includes extra batteries, a charging hub, DJI RC Plus 2 controller, gimbal protector, microSD card, and other essential accessories for enterprise-grade fieldwork readiness.
